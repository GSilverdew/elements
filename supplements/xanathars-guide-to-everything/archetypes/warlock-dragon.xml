			<p>You've made a pact with a mighty dragon, who has bestowed you with a fraction of its terrifying power. The details of the arrangement varies widely - a metallic dragon may have made the pact to create a force of good or save a life, a chromatic dragon may have made their pact with you in exhange for service... or part of some manipulative plan that the minds of lesser mortals would struggle to comprehend.</p>
			<p class="indent">Most often these bonds are granted by ancient dragons steeped in immense power and knowledge, but sometimes partnerships of the lesser mortals and younger dragons have been recorded in more unique classes </p>

		<description>
			<p>Beginning at first level, you gain the ability to unleash blasts of primal draconic energy from your hand or mouth. You can unleash this power in a 30 foot cone or a 60 foot long, 5 food wide line. Invocations that apply to eldritch blast also apply to Draconic Blast (increases to range apply half as much range to the line form, and one quarter the range of the cone).</p>
			<p class="indent">When you gain this feature, select one damage type of acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. Creatures in the area of effect must make a Dexterity saving throw, or take 1d10 elemental damage of the selected type. This feature's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level in Warlock (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).</p>
			<p class="indent">When you use this ability, you can expend a pact magic spell slot to empower the draconic blast, dealing 1d10 additional damage per level of the pact magic slot expended. When empowered, it heals half damage even against creatures that pass their saving throw against it.</p>

			<p>Starting at 14th level, the radiant energy you channel allows you to resist death. When you have to make a death saving throw at the start of your turn, you can instead spring back to your feet with a burst of radiant energy. You regain hit points equal to half your hit point maximum, and then you stand up if you so choose. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes radiant damage equal to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier, and it is blinded until the end of the current turn. </p>
